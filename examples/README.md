# GTA V Pilot

This is a simple example on how to use pyhookv. It does require the GameHook python plugin to load the script.

Copy `pyhookv.pyd` and `gtapiloy.py` in the game directory and press `F10` to start the autopilot. The script will then teleport the player to a certain map location, optionally get a vehicle and drive/walk for 30s, then repeat.

Make sure to enable to first person view before you start the script (press `v` a bunch).
